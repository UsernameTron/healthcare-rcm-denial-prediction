DENIAL PREDICTION AND AUTOMATION
Predictive Precision: Minimize Denials, Maximize Revenue, Optimize Outcomes

INTRODUCTION
Predictive Analytics for Healthcare Denial Rates

In this project, we built and validated a predictive analytics pipeline to analyze historical
healthcare claims data and forecast the likelihood of claim denials for upcoming encounters. This
workflow integrates historical denial trends, payer rules, and claim-specific features (such as CPT
codes, ICD codes, and payer rules) to predict denial risks and help decision-makers address
potential issues proactively.

1. We tackle a significant inefficiency in healthcare Revenue Cycle Management (RCM) by
addressing the time-intensive process of managing "no response" claims, which constitute
approximately 10-15% of total claims.

2. These are claims where payers neither deny nor pay within the standard 30-day
timeframe, requiring analysts to manually gather critical information from payer portals.

3. Through the development of advanced workflows, this project streamlines the process by
automating key steps such as determining claim acceptance, payment details (e.g., amount,
account, check number), denial reasons, and dates, or the status of claims still in process.

4. By automating or structuring this process, we significantly reduce manual effort, free up
valuable analyst resources, and ensure that claims are seamlessly assigned to appropriate
workflows for resolution.

5. This effort not only improves operational efficiency but also positions your organization to
recover revenue faster and with greater accuracy.

MESSAGE FROM APPLICATION CREATOR
The MindMeld advanced reasoning model was tuned to run several simulated outcomes. This
approach can transform revenue cycle management by utilizing automation and advanced
analytics. This will lead to:

Streamlined claim processes and minimized revenue leakage.
Faster resolution of "no response" claims through automated workflows.
Resource optimization by freeing analysts from repetitive tasks, allowing focus on high-value
activities.
Improved accuracy in claim tracking with reduced human error.
Proactive denial prevention using predictive analytics to identify high-risk claims.
Accelerated payment recovery through quicker follow-ups.
Scalable management of claims to handle increased volumes without added administrative
burden.

These efficiencies enhance operations and yield significant financial benefits, including faster
reimbursements and improved cash flow.

OBJECTIVES
01. Build Matrix for Predictive Model
Demonstrate strong classification accuracy, effectively distinguishing between denied and
paid claims with minimal errors. High precision and recall indicate it predicts denials well, 
allowing for proactive responses.

02. Establish Denial Rate Trends
Establish trends where denial rates/reasons vary over time, indicating patterns of high risk.
Investigate months with spikes to identify systemic issues, such as policy changes or payer 
behavior, and implement preventive measures for similar future periods.

03. Denial Likelihood for Upcoming Encounters
Identify encounters that have a higher likelihood of denial, making them priority cases for review.
Alert RCM to review documentation, compliance with payer rules, and any missing pre-authorizations 
before submission.

04. Feature Importance from Predictive Model
Certain features like payer rules, CPT codes, and ICD codes significantly impact claim denial
predictions. Prioritize these high-impact factors for auditing and compliance to minimize denial
risks.

05. Identify Automation and Improvement
Aid the proof of concept by determining the necessary framework.

The synthesized dataset contains a total of 6,685 claims spanning the date range from January
31, 2022, to December 31, 2024.

PROCESSING PATHS AND WORKFLOW AUTOMATIONS

MEASURING PROGRESS
To evaluate the success of this initiative, we will leverage insights from our visual data to establish
clear benchmarks and performance metrics. The confusion matrix will be employed to assess the
predictive model's precision and recall, ensuring a minimal error rate in classifying denied versus
paid claims. We will also monitor trends in denial rates over time to identify and address systemic
issues or seasonal fluctuations, implementing targeted interventions to mitigate risks during peak
periods.

Additionally, feature importance analysis will support compliance audits by pinpointing the most
significant payer rules, CPT codes, and ICD codes, thereby facilitating actionable improvements.
The distribution of predicted denial risks will enable efficient resource allocation, prioritizing
claims that exceed the high-risk threshold. Finally, we will validate denial likelihood predictions for
upcoming encounters by tracking corrective actions taken on high-risk claims and their
subsequent resolution outcomes. Collectively, these metrics will foster a data-driven approach to
optimizing claims workflows, reducing revenue leakage, and enhancing operational efficiency.

AREA | KEY DATA | OUTCOME
-----|----------|--------
Predicted Denial Risk Distribution | Proportions of claims falling above the high-risk threshold (e.g., >70% predicted denial likelihood) and resolution rates for these claims. | Improved efficiency in resource allocation by prioritizing high-risk claims, leading to quicker resolutions and reduced financial risk.
Denial Likelihood Validation | Number of high-risk claims corrected preemptively and their corresponding resolution outcomes, including approval rates after intervention. | Increased acceptance rates for high-risk claims through effective pre-submission corrections, demonstrating the model's ability to drive actionable improvements.
Confusion Matrix Performance Tracking | Precision, recall, and F1-score metrics for denied and paid/accepted claims, along with the overall classification accuracy. | High values for these metrics (e.g., >90% accuracy) reflect the model's effectiveness in accurately distinguishing denied claims, enabling targeted intervention and reducing misclassification.
