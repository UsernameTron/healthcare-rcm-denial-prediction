Healthcare Claims Denial Prediction Project
Overview
This project develops an advanced predictive analytics solution for healthcare Revenue Cycle Management (RCM), focusing on minimizing claim denials and optimizing revenue recovery. By leveraging machine learning and data-driven insights, the system helps healthcare organizations proactively manage and reduce claim rejection risks.
Key Features
Predictive Modeling

Analyzes historical claims data to forecast denial probabilities
Achieves over 90% accuracy in predicting claim outcomes
Identifies high-risk claims before submission

Workflow Automation

Streamlines claim processing through intelligent automation
Reduces manual intervention in claim management
Provides targeted interventions for high-risk claims

Comprehensive Analysis

Processes 6,685 claims across a 36-month period
Examines multiple factors influencing claim denials:

Payer rules
CPT and ICD-10 codes
Provider specialties
Seasonal variations
